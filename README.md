# Connect4-
Simple game with AI

Connect Four is a game where two players alternate turns
dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. Each player uses a different
color, and the objective of the game is to be the first player to get four
discs in a row.

First step will be set up the game environment and a very simple
implementation of dropping discs randomly.

Then heuristic function will be used to assign a score to each possible
valid move and select the move that gets the highest score.

After this, the minimax algorithm will be used to help the agent look
farther into the future and make better-informed decisions.

Next step will be replace the heuristic with a neural network and train
model.

In the end it will be able to compare results of all implementation and
analyze performance.
